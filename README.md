## Dataset
The Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ) is a database collected by University of Southern California, which contains a multimodal collection of semi-structured clinical interviews. Those interviews were designed to support the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions such as depression. Despite this corpus contains four types of interviews, this particularly part of the corpus includes the Wizard-of-Oz interviews, conducted by an animated virtual interviewer, Ellie, controlled by a human in another room.
